# Dodo

Dodo is a CLI tool that automates the creation and validation of `.github/workflows/*.yml` files, eliminating the need for manual writing, copy-pasting, and troubleshooting. It ensures correctness in workflow configurations and provides prebuilt templates for various use cases.

## Features
