# Dodo

Dodo is a CLI tool that automates the creation and optimization of GitHub Actions workflows.  
Instead of manually writing `.github/workflows/*.yml` files, Dodo generates, validates, and updates them based on project structure and user configurations.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Dodo is in its early days, and I am actively working on **v0.1.0**. Some features may not work, and the docs may be outdated. 

## Why Dodo? (Planned features)
- Automatic workflow generation based on best practices.
- Fetch and update actions from [Dox](https://github.com/dodomatic/dox/).
- Adapts workflows based on language and repository setup.
- Fast and reliable, built in Rust.
- Configurable via `dodo.toml`.
