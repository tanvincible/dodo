# Welcome to Dodo  

Dodo is a privacy-first tool that automates and optimizes GitHub workflows.  
Instead of manually writing and managing `.github/workflows/*.yml` files, Dodo analyzes your project, understands its structure, and generates efficient workflowsâ€”while keeping everything local and secure.  

Born out of frustration with repetitive CI/CD setup, Dodo simplifies the process by:  
- Detecting tools and dependencies like Clippy, Ruff, and Cargo.  
- Generating GitHub Actions workflows tailored to your project.  
- Scanning for exposed secrets and vulnerabilities.  
- Integrating with raphus.io for fetching and adapting workflow templates.  

## Why Dodo?  
- No more manual `.yml` filesâ€”Dodo takes care of it.  
- Local-first AI for privacy and speed.  
- Optimized performance with caching and parallel execution.  
- Scalable for both small projects and large codebases.  

Dodo is still in development, focusing on core features first.  

Stay tuned for updates or contribute to the project! ðŸš€
