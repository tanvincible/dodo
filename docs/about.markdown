# About Dodo

Hi, I’m [Tanvi](https://github.com/tanvincible)—the creator behind Dodo.  
I built Dodo out of my own frustration with the endless cycle of manually editing and debugging GitHub Actions workflows. I was tired of copy-pasting YAML files, only to have small mistakes derail my deployments. So, I decided to create a tool that would take care of all that for me.

## Why Dodo?

_Make CI/CD workflows effortless!_

I believe developers should spend their time building and innovating, not wrestling with configuration files.

With Dodo, my goal is simple: automate the creation and optimization of CI/CD workflows so that you can focus on what really matters—writing great code.

## My Journey

Dodo started as a personal project born out of necessity. While working on various projects, I kept running into the same problem: manually setting up and maintaining GitHub Actions workflows was repetitive, error-prone, and just plain annoying. I wanted a tool that could analyze a project’s structure and automatically generate reliable workflows, tailored to the project’s needs.

## What Dodo Does

- **Automates Workflow Generation:** No more manual YAML tweaks.
- **Ensures Reliability:** Validates configurations to catch errors before they cause issues.
- **Customizes Workflows:** Uses a simple `dodo.toml` and `dodo.lock` files to adapt to your project’s specific setup.

## Looking Ahead

Dodo is still a work in progress, and I’m excited to see where it goes. I’m building it for developers who, like me, want to streamline their workflow setup and avoid the tedious parts of CI/CD configuration.  
I welcome your feedback, ideas, and contributions—let’s build something awesome together.

Thanks for checking out Dodo.  
Here’s to smoother workflows and more time for coding!
